# Chapter 1

The C++ compiler sequentially goes through each line of the source code.  if the line of code is free of errors , the line of code is executed.  If the C++ source code is completely free of errors, the sorce code is conveted into a machine language.  The coputer reads the machine language and converts the machine language into an executable.

The execution path is the sequence in which the computer executes statements.  The execution path is sequential unless a flow-of-constrol statement is written.  Flow-of-control statements are controlled by condition statements.  A condition result is either true or false.  If the condition is true the flow-of-control statement(s) are executed.
