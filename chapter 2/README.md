# Chapter 2 Variables and Basic Types

## Section 2.1 - Primitive Built-in Types

There are two arithmetic types: integral types and floating-point types.  The standard sizes of arithmetic types can only guarantee minimum size across various compilers.  Types may be signed or unsigned.  Signed types can hold zero, positive, and negative numbers.  Unsigned types can hold zero and positive numbers.  char, short, int, long, and long long are integer types.  float, double, and long double are the three floating point types.  bool takes the value of either ture or false.

| Type Name | Bytes | Range of Values
--- | --- | ---
bool | 1 | true or false
--- | --- | ---
short | 2 | -32768 to 32767
--- | --- | ---
unsigned short | 2 | 0 to 65535
--- | --- | ---
int | 4 | -2147483648 to 2147483647
